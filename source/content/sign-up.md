Creating a Pantheon account requires just a few pieces of information, and **does not require** providing a payment method.

To create an account:

1. Go to the [Registration page](https://pantheon.io/register?docs).

1. Enter your name, email, company name, password, country and state.

1. Read and accept the terms of service.

1. Click **Create Account**.  Your account will be created (it may take a few moments), and a login page will appear.

When you log in for the first time, there will be a welcome screen where you can choose to:

- [Create a new site](/guides/quickstart/create-new-site/)

- [Migrate an existing site](/get-started)

- [Set up your team](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/teams)
