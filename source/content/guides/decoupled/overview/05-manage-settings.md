Build Hooks allow you to trigger a build automatically when you update the content in your content management system (CMS). You can use Build Hooks for your Front-End site if your CMS is hosted on Pantheon or hosted elsewhere.

Your Pantheon Front-End site will rebuild and include your new content when a Build Hook is triggered. Each Build Hook you generate has a unique URL.

You can create and manage Build Hooks in the Pantheon Dashboard. You must
 [configure your backend](/guides/decoupled/overview/build-hooks#use-build-hooks-with-a-backend-starter-kit) to use the Build Hooks you create in the Pantheon dashboard.

1. Optional. Copy the cURL code under **Test** if you want to test triggering a build with your hook.
