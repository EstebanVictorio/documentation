Pantheon Decoupled Early Access (EA) program currently supports Gatsby and Next.js as frontend frameworks. Additional frameworks will be added to our official support list over the coming months.

You can use frontend frameworks other Gatsby and Next.js. Note that while other frameworks are an option, we do not support all frameworks at this time. The process for non-officially supported frontend frameworks requires manual configuration.

## Before You Begin

- Know the type of framework you will use.
    - Is it a static or server-side rendering framework? This will matter when you are creating your site.

- Examine the build command for the framework you have chosen. Depending on the framework, you may need to adjust files to build a decoupled site successfully.
    - If the build command used is `build`, you do not have to do anything for your build commands, although you may need to pay attention to Root Directory and Output Directory as these may be different for the framework used.
    - If your framework uses a different command, you must adjust the build command on the build settings page. For example, if you have a static site framework that uses the command `npm run generate`, you must input `generate` as the build command.


## Create Your Site
