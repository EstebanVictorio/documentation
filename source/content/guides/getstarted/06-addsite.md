There are dozens of ways to add a site on Pantheon. This section covers the most common scenarios for new users: creating a new CMS site (a site running WordPress or Drupal), or migrating an existing WordPress or Drupal site.  For additional scenarios, see the [More Resources](/guides/getstarted/addsite#more-resources) section at the end of this document.

## Create a New CMS Site

To create a CMS site:

1. Open your Personal or Professional Workspace dashboard and select the yellow <Icon icon="plus" text="Create New Site"/> button on the lower right side of the page.

   ![Create new site button](../../../images/create-new-site-button.png)

1. Select **WordPress** or **Drupal**.

   ![Select CMS](../../../images/create-new-site-cms.png)

   If you select Drupal, you will have the option to select the Drupal version you want to use.

   ![Select Drupal version](../../../images/create-new-site-cms-drupal.png)

1. Enter the name and select a region for this site. If this site is to be part of a Professional Workspace, select a Workspace from **Choose a Workspace for the Site**. Click **Continue**. It can take several minutes to create a new site on Pantheon.

   ![Enter site information](../../../images/create-new-site-info.png)

   <Alert title="Note" type="info" >

   You can navigate away from this page during this process, but later, you'll have to go to the **Sites** tab to access your site.  If possible, stay on this tab to simplify accessing the site when the creation is complete.

   </Alert>

1. Click **Visit your Pantheon Site Dashboard** when the process is complete.

   ![Site creation completed](../../../images/create-site-done.png)

At this point, you have a Dev environment for your site code, but you do not have a Dev environment for your CMS.  To create that:

1. Click **Site Admin**. A new browser tab will open, and you will be presented with your CMS setup screen.

1. Enter the information on the screen, and when done, return to the browser tab containing your Site Dashboard.

   <Alert title="Note" type="info">

   Be sure to record your new username and password.

   </Alert>

You have successfully finished adding a site in its Dev environment!

## Migrate an Existing Site

If you already have a site hosted elsewhere, you can move it over to Pantheon with minimal effort.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger" >

If your migration needs include any of the following, **do not use this process**, and instead refer to the specified documentation:

- You are moving a Drupal site **and** want to upgrade to the latest version of Drupal:

   - Your site *is* Composer-managed: [Migrate a Composer Managed Drupal Site from Another Platform](/guides/drupal-unhosted-composer) or [Import Drush Site Archives with Terminus](/guides/drush/drush-import)

   - Your site is *not* Composer-managed: [Migrate a Drupal Site from Another Platform](/guides/drupal-unhosted)

- You are using WordPress Multisite: [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual)

- You are using WordPress and don't want to install the plugin required for migration: [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual)

- You are migrating a site that is only on your local machine: [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual)

- The site or site archive is greater than 500MB: [Manually Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/migrate-manual)

</Alert>

### Before you Begin

1. Check your plugins and/or modules against [Modules and Plugins with Known Issues](/modules-plugins-known-issues).

1. Make sure your code is compatible with the latest recommended version of PHP for your CMS. If not, be prepared to [adjust PHP versions](/guides/php/php-versions/#configure-php-version).

1. Remove unneeded code, database tables, and files.

### Perform the Migration

<TabList>

<Tab title="WordPress" id="tab-1-id" active={true}>

This process will install a WordPress plugin.  If you don't want to use a plugin, migrate your site manually.

1. Open your Personal or Professional Workspace dashboard and select the **Migrate Existing Site** button on the lower right side of the page.

   ![Migrate site button](../../../images/migrate-site-button.png)

1. Enter your current website URL, select **WordPress**, and click **Continue**.

   ![Enter URL and select CMS](../../../images/migrate-site-cms.png)

1. Enter the name of your new Pantheon site, select a workspace for the site (optional), and click **Create Site**.

   ![Install Plugin](../../../images/migrate-site-info.png)

1. Select **Generate Machine Token** and re-authenticate if prompted.

   ![Begin process of installing plugin](../../../images/migrate-site-wp-plugin.png)

1. Select **Install on /wp-admin**.  A new tab will open with your WordPress CMS for your existing site. Keep the Pantheon tab open in your browser.

1. Search for and install the plugin.

   ![Searching for plugin on WordPress](../../../images/migrate-site-wp-search-plugin.png)

1. Click **Activate**.

   ![Copying and pasting info](../../../images/migrate-site-wp-activate.png)

1. Navigate back to the browser tab containing your Pantheon dashboard, copy the machine token from the Pantheon Dashboard, then go back to the WordPress Dashboard on your existing site. Paste the machine token and the site name, and click **Migrate**

   ![Copying and pasting info](../../../images/migrate-site-wp-activate-info.png)

 When the migration is complete, the **Migration completed successfully** page appears.

   ![Migration successful](../../../images/migrate-site-wp-successful.png)

1. Return to the Pantheon tab and click **Confirm migration progress**.  Your site's dashboard appears.

You have successfully migrated a site to its Pantheon Dev environment!

</Tab>

<Tab title="Drupal" id="tab-2-id">

The recommended way to migrate Drupal sites from another host is to use `drush ard` (Drush 8 or earlier) to create an archive that can be easily imported.

1. Open your Personal or Professional Workspace dashboard and click the **Migrate Existing Site** button.

   ![Migrate site button](../../../images/migrate-site-button.png)

1. Enter your current website URL, select **Drupal 7** or **Drupal 8**, and click **Continue**.

   ![Enter URL and select CMS](../../../images/migrate-site-cms-drupal.png)

1. Enter the name of your new Pantheon site, select a workspace for the site (optional), and click **Create Site**.

   ![Install Plugin](../../../images/migrate-site-drupal-create-site.png)

1. Follow the instructions to **Create an Archive of Your Existing Site With Drush**:

  ![Drupal create archive](../../../images/dashboard/drupal-guided-migrate.png)

  The Dashboard instructs you to put the archive on your existing website, but you can put the site archive on Dropbox, S3, or any number of other places. The important thing is that you have a site archive that can be downloaded via a publicly accessible URL.

  Click **Continue Migration**

1. Paste the publicly accessible URL to a download of your site archive on the right side of the page. If you are using a Dropbox URL, change the end of the URL from `dl=0` to `dl=1` so we can import your site archive correctly.

   ![Import archive](../../../images/migrate-site-drupal-import-archive.png)

1. Click **Import Archive** and then click **Visit the Site Dashboard** from the Site Dashboard on Pantheon after the import is complete.

 ![Successful Drupal Migration](../../../images/dashboard/successful-drupal-migration.png)

You have successfully migrated a site to its Dev environment!

Now it's time to purchase a site plan in preparation for launching your site.
